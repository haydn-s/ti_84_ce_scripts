# TI-84 CE Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I have created and used on my TI-84 CE calculator, mostly as fun projects to implement mathematical concepts I've learned into a usable tool.
The language used for these scripts is the TI-Basic language, which can be used in the TI Connect CE IDE linked below:
